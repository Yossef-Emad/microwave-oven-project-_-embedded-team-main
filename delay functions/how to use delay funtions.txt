1- call SysTick_Init() to initialize the SysTick Timer

2- call delay_onems() to make delay one millisecond

3- call delay_oneus() to make delay one microsecond

4- call delay_ms(*time in milliseconds*) and give it unsigned integer value represents time in milliseconds to make delay with this value

5- call delay_us(*time in microseconds*) and give it unsigned integer value represents time in milliseconds to make delay with this value

6- call delay_portA_interrupt(**) to stop count down when switch is pressed
