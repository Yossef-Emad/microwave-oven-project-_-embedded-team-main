This folder (Other Codes folder) contains the codes which we are working on it in parallel

//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

for example ======> The timer Function

there were more than one person working on it and each person has his own idea to implement it

so, everyone started to implement his own idea so, finally we have many implementaion for the timer 

then we tested them and choose the working one and the best one in coding style "we have chosen the most Optimized one " and used it in the main code

Note: the 3 timer functions were working fine but we have choosen the most optimized one
